            Throughout my education I've developed a handful of social and technical skills which include: <br/><br/>
            Leadership, social and organisational skills acquired through organising school activities and the
            work I've done at <a href="https://nowyouth.org/"> nowYouth </a>as VP Marketing.<br/><br/>
            Aside from that, my more technical skills include programming in C and C++, HTML, CSS, Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Photoshop and Unity,
            all of which I've acquired throughout my education, including different projects and competitions/hackathons.
