            I spent my high school years at Yahya Kemal College - Struga. There I studied subjects ranging from the different
            natural and social sciences, went to different state competitions, organised several club activities and was
            elected valedictorian of the class. <br/><br/>
            Starting from Autumn 2022 to the present day I am continuing my formal education as I've enrolled in the computer
            science course at FINKI, Skopje. Currently, I  have a GPA of 9.8, and I am working on several projects connected
            to my field of study.
